# Overview

This example shows how to show a popup in an application.

A popup is a menu that appears over the content of the application.
It is used to inform or to request an action from the user.

In this example, these two types of popup are illustrated.
The information popup can be hidden by clicking outside of its bounds.
Whereas the other popup need the user to click on a button to close it.
