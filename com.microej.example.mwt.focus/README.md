# Overview

This example shows how to introduce focus management in a project.

The application contains only one page.
The page contains:

  - on the left, a title, a list with selectable items and a button,
  - on the right a software joystick.

The joystick is used to simulate with a pointer a board with buttons or a joystick.
When the joystick directions (up, down, left, right) are pressed, the focus changes on the items.
When the joystick center button is pressed, the focused item is selected (printing a message in the standard output).
