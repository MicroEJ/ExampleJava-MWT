# Overview

This example shows how to create and use a MVC design pattern.

The application contains only one page with three widgets: a text, a bar and a pie.
All these widgets display the same value from the same model.

The value of the model can be changed by clicking on the board button.

It is also possible to resize all the widgets at once by selecting the cross between the widgets and moving it.

A cursor is also shown under the pointer (implemented by defining a new RenderPolicy).
