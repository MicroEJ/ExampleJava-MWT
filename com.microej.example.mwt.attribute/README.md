# Overview

This example shows how to customize the style of widgets using attributes selectors, similar to CSS.

The application contains only one page with two widgets: a button and a label.
The label holds an attribute that can be `ON` or `OFF`.
The button is used to toggle the value of the attribute in the label (and its text).
